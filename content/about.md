### Work

I write code and touch computers for a living. I have recently relocated from Amsterdam back to my hometown of Richmond, Virginia and I am taking a few months off work to travel the country.

Previously I have worked at:
* [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com) as a Software Engineer writing software to manage a monstrously fast NoSQL database and run it in the cloud.
* [summitto](https://summitto.com) as a Software and Systems Engineer creating software and infrastructure to help fight VAT fraud across Europe.
* [bol.com](https://www.bol.com/) as a Systems Engineer maintaining and improving the storage and backup infrastructure for the largest online retailer in The Netherlands and Belgium.
* [Virginia Commonwealth University](https://www.vcu.edu) as the Technical Lead for a team of System Engineers running the university's ERP infrastructure.
* [STR Software](https://www.strsoftware.com) as a Software Engineer developing mission critical document delivery and mobile work order solutions.


### Else

When I'm not touching computers I enjoy [biking](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAAkaIsF_Ko/), [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGwmpCfFaDo/), [whitewater sports](https://www.instagram.com/p/BghseaCjq5L/), and [other](https://www.instagram.com/p/B19TCXglrdx/) [outdoor](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlkzQo5n783/) [adventures](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByRNf2LFCLv/).
